# Python script for Qbittorrent
I used to have a limited internet quota. So I made this python script to automatically pause torrents then close qbittorrent and shutdown pc when the data of the dowloaded torrent file in the current session exceeds the limit you set when you first run the program.

The following script definitely works -

In windows folder:
```python
python qbit_script_downlimit.py
```
---

The other files I made to add additional quality of life features in the script but I have forgotten if they worked or not. It has been around 4 years since I used it because now I have unlimited internet.


- I don't remember about linux but I tested it on windows 10 and it worked there.
- the .env file doesn't contain anything important. I don't remember why I made it but if I were to delete it or add it to gitignore, it might break something so I am tracking it as it is.
